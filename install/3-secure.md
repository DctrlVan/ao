### KeePassX - shared passwords
KeePassX is GNU licensed password manager that is open-source and cross-platform. We use it for our passwords because Lastpass is limited to sharing to a certain amount of users. Be aware that in order for your members to have access to the passwords they will need access to the database file and the master password. We host our database file on the server and on Keybase.io through a shared team folder.

- The easiest way to install it would be through the Ubuntu Software application that comes with Ubuntu
- In the app search and install "KeePassX"
- When you setup your KeePassX database, do not use a "Key File". Since many people will have access to the database, there's no need to create a keyfile.
- KeePassX is cross platform any member who has access to the database file and master password can use it.
- You can create as many databases as you want with different master passwords.
- More granular permissioning can be done within any KeePassX database
